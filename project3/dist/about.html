          <h3>Urban Outfitters</h3>
          <h6>Sales Associate</h6>
          <p>
            Currently I am working at Urban Outfitters to learn more about the
            customer experience in retail stores. The user experience in
            clothing stores is highly dependent on the store associates that
            keep the store clean, help assist customers, and uphold the
            company's values. In the future I would like to work on creating a
            better retail experience for people of all ages.

          <p>
            In the summer of 2018 I worked at the Office of Mayor Pete to learn
            more about the operation that is needed to boost a public figure.
            There are many people that are involved in the mayor's office and I
            had the pleasure of creating promotional content for Bloomberg
            Philanthropies, Uber, and the City of South Bend Mayor's Challenge.
            The city of South Bend went on to win an award of 1 million dollars
            to be used to improve transportation services in the city.
